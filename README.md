Funiq (fuzzy uniq) is a command line tool for performing fuzzy string matching against lists of words. To compile, clone the source and run make at the project's root; the funiq binary will be compiled to the bin/ directory.

As an example, consider the file test.txt:

	The Fellowship of The Ring
	the fellowship ofteh reing
	The Flopship of the Rung
	Felloship of the Ring
	The Two Towers
	The Twin Towers
	the towers
	The Return of the King
	Return of the King
	Teh return of theking

Running funiq on this list and telling it to ignore casing (-i) and non-alphanumeric characters (-I)

	$ funiq -iI test.txt

Results in:

	Felloship of the Ring
	The Fellowship of The Ring
	The Flopship of the Rung
	The Return of the King
	The Two Towers

Which is ok, but it hasn't produced the desired results with The Fellowship of the Ring. Using the -d option, we can increase the threshold at which matches are considered (default is 3):

	$ funiq -iI -d 4 test.txt

	The Fellowship of The Ring
	The Return of the King
	The Two Towers
 
Which is what we were looking for.

Funiq can read from a file or have its input piped from stdin.

    USAGE: 
    
       bin/funiq  [-I] [-c] [-a] [-i] [-d <number>] [-m <levenshtein
                  |normalized-levenshtein>] [--] [--version] [-h] <filename>
    
    
    Where: 
    
       -I,  --ignore-non-alpha-numeric
         When active, non-alphanumeric characters do not contribute to edit
         distance.
    
       -c,  --show-counts
         Precede each output line with the count of the number of times the
         line occurredin the input, followed by a single space.
    
       -a,  --show-all
         Will show all found duplicates
    
       -i,  --case-insensitive
         When active, case differences do not contribute to edit distance.
    
       -d <number>,  --distance <number>
         Maximum distance threshold between two strings to be considered
         duplicates.
    
         For the default Levenshtein comparison method, it is the maximum edit
         distance allowed for two strings to be considered duplicates.
    
         For the Normalized Levenshtein comparison method, it is a number
         between 0.0 and 1.0 representing 0% and 100% similarity respectively.
    
       -m <levenshtein|normalized-levenshtein>,  --method <levenshtein
          |normalized-levenshtein>
         The method used to compare similarity of strings. Defaults to
         'levenshtein'
    
       --,  --ignore_rest
         Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.
    
       --version
         Displays version information and exits.
    
       -h,  --help
         Displays usage information and exits.
    
       <filename>
         File to read. If omitted will read from stdin.
    
    
       funiq - Fuzzy Unique Filtering

# Installation

You will need the GNU compiler collection installed, along with the make build tool. Clone the project, and run

```
make
```

in the project directory. The test project should compile and run, followed by the `funiq` tool itself. The compiled binary is placed in `bin/funiq`.
